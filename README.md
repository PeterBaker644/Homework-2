# Sample Portfolio Website

This is a sample website created to show knowledge of Bootstrap and responsive design. The requirements of the assignment included a navbar, a responsive layout, responsive images, and the minimization of media queries. The site must also correctly utilize the bootstrap grid system, have working links, and semantic html. Style, colors, and images were picked to align as closely to given sample images within reason. Some additional .css was used on top of existing bootstrap to achieve this, though the goal of the assignment was to attempt this using as little additional .css as possible.
